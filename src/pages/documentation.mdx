  ],

}
```

#### Error Responses
- **401 Unauthorized**: Returned if the `Authorization` header is missing or the API key is invalid.
- **429 Too Many Requests**: Returned if the request rate limit is exceeded. The rate limit is 10 requests per hour per API key.

#### Rate Limiting
Rate limiting is enforced using a Redis key based on the `Authorization` header. If the number of requests exceeds the limit within an hour, subsequent requests will receive a 429 status code. The limit resets after one hour.

#### Example
```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "question": "What is your favorite programming language?",

      "JavaScript",
      "Java",
      "C#",
      "C++",
