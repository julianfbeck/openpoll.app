### Endpoint: Create Poll

This endpoint allows clients to create a new poll. Clients must be authorized to use this endpoint.

#### HTTP Method
`POST`

#### Endpoint
`/api/poll/create`

#### Headers
- `Authorization`: A valid API key to authenticate the request.

#### Request Body
The request body must be a JSON object that contains the following properties:
- `question`: A string representing the poll question.
- `options`: An array of strings representing the poll options.

```json
{
  "question": "What is your favorite programming language?",
  "options": [
    "Python",
    "JavaScript",
    "Java",
    "C#",
    "C++",
    "Go",
    "Ruby",
    "Swift",
    "Kotlin",
    "Rust"
  ]
}
```

#### Successful Response
A successful response returns HTTP status 200 along with the poll details in JSON format, including a unique URL for accessing the poll and an API URL for further interactions.

```json

  "id": 31,
  "question": "What is your favorite programming language?",
  "timestamp": "2024-04-13T15:10:01",

  "options": [
    {
      "id": 69,
      "pollId": 31,
      "option": "Python",
      "votes": 0
    },
    {
      "id": 70,
      "pollId": 31,
      "option": "JavaScript",
      "votes": 0
    },
    // Additional options omitted for brevity
  ],
  "url": "https://openpoll.app/PK_IOGjY5i", // Used to accecc the poll on the web
  "api_url": "http://openpoll.app/api/poll/PK_IOGjY5i" // Used to interact with the poll via the API
}
```

#### Error Responses
- **401 Unauthorized**: Returned if the `Authorization` header is missing or the API key is invalid.
- **429 Too Many Requests**: Returned if the request rate limit is exceeded. The rate limit is 10 requests per hour per API key.

#### Rate Limiting
Rate limiting is enforced using a Redis key based on the `Authorization` header. If the number of requests exceeds the limit within an hour, subsequent requests will receive a 429 status code. The limit resets after one hour.

#### Example
```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "question": "What is your favorite programming language?",
    "options": [
      "Python",
      "JavaScript",
      "Java",
      "C#",
      "C++",
      "Go",
      "Ruby",
      "Swift",
      "Kotlin",
      "Rust"
    ]
  }' \
